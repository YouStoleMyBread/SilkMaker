# SilkMaker
Silkmaker Is what a Modern Twine I think should look like, The core design was built with Replit, and as I am still learning don't have the skills to implement some of the stuff I want myself yet. Please if you have the skill and are interested, start a pull request, offer help if you are interested and lets get this made!, thank you.


To preview this, clone the code and install the dependices and run, but it is currently broken, has a bug where you can't get to the editor, first thing that needs to be fixed, like I said help needed. If you think you can fork this and make it better then go ahead.
