# SilkMaker
Silkmaker Is what a Modern Twine I think should look like, The core design was built with Replit, and as I am still learning don't have the skills to implement some of the stuff I want myself yet. Please if you have the skill and are interested, start a pull request, offer help if you are interested and lets get this made!, thank you.
